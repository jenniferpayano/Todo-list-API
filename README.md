Description
------------
This is a task tracking application user interface written in React by me [Jennifer Payano].
I wanted to create this application to keep track of things that need to get done for a project.
The goal of the application is to write who is responsible for the task, when it is completed, and when it is due.

The deployed user interface application url: http://jenniferpayano.com/Todo-list-Client/

This site API is deployed to: https://task-list-ga.herokuapp.com/

PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT
------------------------
To plan this appliction, I knew that I would want to built an application that will help me keep track of task I need to completed for each project. This is a simulation of Jira technology to keep track of user stories. Development included a table in React that meets all the CRUD requirements, in addition once the task is completed the table will show the task crossed accross as a symbol that is completed.

USER STORIES
------------
- As a user I want to sign up into my application
- As a user I want to sign in into my application
- As a user I want to change my password when logged in
- As a user I want to create a task with a project name, description, who is
  responsible, the priority, add comments, mark the due date, and wether it has
  been completed.
- As a user I want the created a task to display on my table
- As a user I want to update the task and its values
- As a user once the task is completed I want to mark it as completed
- As a user I want to delete the tasks that belong to ME if any mistakes have been made.
- As a user I want to sign out of my application when Im done with my task.
